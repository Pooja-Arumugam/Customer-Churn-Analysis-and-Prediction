# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project involved working with SQL Server, Power BI, and Machine Learning to analyze customer behavior and predict churn.

🔍 Project Overview:
1️⃣ Data Preparation

Imported a dataset named customer_data into Microsoft SQL Server
Created a database data_churn and structured it by adjusting column data types
Staged the data in stg_churn and handled missing values
Created two SQL views:
🔹 vw_churn_data – To analyze churned customers
🔹 vw_joindatam – To track new customer sign-ups
2️⃣ Power BI Dashboard – Churn Analysis

Built an interactive dashboard to analyze:
✅ Demographics: Gender, Age
✅ Account Details: Payment Methods, Contracts
✅ Geographic Trends
✅ Service Usage: Internet & Phone Services
✅ Churn Distribution
3️⃣ Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

Exported SQL views into Excel for modeling
Used Logistic Regression to predict future churn
Achieved 96% accuracy! 🚀
Identified key factors influencing churn: Monthly Income, Total Refunds, Total Revenue, etc.
Stored predictions in a CSV file joined_data_predictions
4️⃣ Power BI – Churn Prediction Dashboard

Visualized churn probability for new customers
Explored how revenue, refunds, and references impact churn
🔮 Key Takeaways:
✔ SQL is powerful for data preprocessing
✔ Power BI enables data storytelling
✔ Machine Learning enhances business decision-making

💡 Next Steps: Deploying this model on a Streamlit dashboard!
